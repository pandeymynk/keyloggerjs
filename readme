# Key Press Tracking Application

This project is a simple web-based key press tracking application. It listens for `keydown` and `keyup` events and logs the key presses and releases, displaying the information in real-time on the webpage.

## Features

- Start and stop tracking of key presses and releases.
- Displays the specific key pressed or released.
- Updates the UI to show the current key state (pressed down or released).

## How It Works

- When the **Start** button is clicked, the app begins listening for key events on the document.
- Key press (`keydown`) and key release (`keyup`) events are captured and displayed in real-time.
- Clicking the **Stop** button stops the event listeners and clears the log.
- The start and stop buttons are enabled/disabled based on the current state.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a browser.
2. Click the **Start** button to begin tracking key events.
3. Press and release any key on the keyboard. The application will display:
   - The key that was pressed.
   - Whether the key is currently pressed or released.
4. Click the **Stop** button to stop tracking.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

The app uses simple HTML elements:
- A `div` to display the log of key events.
- A `div` to display the state of the key (whether it's down or up).
- Two buttons: one to start and one to stop the event tracking.

```html
<div id="log"></div>
<div id="state"></div>
<button id="start-btn">Start</button>
<button id="stop-btn" disabled>Stop</button>
